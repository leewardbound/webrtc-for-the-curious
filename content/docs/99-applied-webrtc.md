# Applied WebRTC

This section is under construction, and needs your help! *Applied WebRTC* is a chapter about how applications get built "in the real world", so it wouldn't be complete without extensive input from the community. If you know something about WebRTC application architecture that isn't covered in this chapter, we want to know about it!

## Common Peering Patterns

Each of these sections should be expanded with a graphical representation of the peering pattern, a description of typical or notable use-cases, and a list of pros/cons or strengths/weaknesses, or "when to use".

### Client-Server
#### SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)
#### MCU (Multi-point Conferencing Unit)

### Peer-To-Peer
#### One-To-One
#### P2P Mesh

## Common Integration Patterns

These topics are a lot more "to each their taste". We'll try to capture all the most common "wish list" requests from the `#pion` room, but since everyone's needs are different here, we'll emphasize listing as many "good solutions" as possible.

### Realtime Encoding (gstreamer, ffmpeg)
### A/V Manipulation (OpenCV)
### Bridging Connections (RTP, RTMP)
